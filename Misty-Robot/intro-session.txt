It’s great to see you again. I hope your day is going well.

Last time, we shared some stories together—would you like to continue from where we left off? Or maybe you’d like to hear something new today?

Remember, I’m always here to help you take a breather and feel refreshed. So, tell me, how can I make this session enjoyable for you?
